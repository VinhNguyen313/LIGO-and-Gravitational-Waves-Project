## Abstract

The detection of gravitational wave signals of astrophysical origins is particularly challenging because the signals are always contaminated by noise. Two of most prominent and efficient de- tection techniques currently used in Virgo/LIGO search pipelines are matched filtering and χ2- consistency testing. This paper investigated the performance of these two detection techniques in event GW170814 as well as in the presence of both consistently distributed noise and transient glitches. It was found that matched filtering performs best in the presence of perfect or close- perfect Gaussian noise; it can also mistake glitches for real gravitational waves if certain types of glitches are present. Additionally, it was found that χ2-consistency testing has little effects in cases where matched filtering had previously been unsuccessful. Finally, it was shown that the use of χ2-consistency testing is crucial to detecting and identifying gravitational waves in the presence of Extremely Loud and Blip glitches.
